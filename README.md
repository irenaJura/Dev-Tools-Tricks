## Console tips and tricks for developers

What else can we do in a console beside the console.log?

%s will insert a string at the place where we set it, while %c can add css styling to what's being logged.

There is console.error and console.info type of messages.

Console.dir will show you more details about an element, like properties and methods etc.

You can group strings together and collapse them under their name with console.groupCollapsed.

Console.count counts the number of times of one instance in the file.

You can measure a time needed for a certain process with console.time.

Also there is a nice way of displaying an array in a table with console.table.
